# tic-tac-toe
A simple command-line game to play tic-tac-toe with two players!

Here I utilize private and public classes, instance variables, and methods using Ruby. I also add the ruby Gem, colorize, the make the winning message red. 

The most difficult part of this program was figuring out how to check if a user made a winning move. I had to iterate through the nested array of winning combinations and check if the respective index combinations matched each other on the game board.
